# FpgaHub

FpgaHub is an FPGA-centric hyper-heterogeneous computing platform for big data analytics. The key idea of FpgaHub is to use reconfigurable computing to implement a versatile hub complementing other processors (CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, programmable switches, computational storage, etc.).

Using an FPGA as the basis, we can take advantage of its highly reconfigurable nature and rich IO interfaces such as PCIe, networking, and on-board memory, to place it at the center of the architecture and use it as a data and control plane for data movement, scheduling, pre-processing, etc. FpgaHub enables architectural flexibility to allow exploring the rich design space of heterogeneous computing platforms.
